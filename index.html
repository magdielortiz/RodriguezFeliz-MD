        <h3>Injectables<br>(Botox / Fillers)</h3>
        <p>Botulinum toxin (Type A) is a cosmetic injection that blocks the nerve signals that cause muscles to contract. This effect relaxes and smooths the look of lines and wrinkles caused by repetitive movements on the face most commonly, between the
          brows, crows-feet around the eyes, and horizontal forehead creases.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="second-procedure">
        <h3>Dermal Fillers<br>(Fillers)</h3>
        <p>Fillers are usually made from hyaluronic acid used to add volume, alter the contours of the face, and fill in wrinkles. Common areas to inject fillers are in the face, neck, and hands, resulting in a fuller, smoother and more youthful appearance.
          Dermal fillers are among the most popular aesthetic procedures.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="third-procedure">
        <h3>Aesthetic Breast Surgery<br>(Augmentation Mammaplasty)</h3>
        <p>Breast augmentation surgery increases or restores breast size using silicone gel implants, saline implants or in some cases, fat transfer. One of the most popular and frequently performed aesthetic surgery procedures, breast augmentation has a
          long and successful track record in satisfying women.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourth-procedure">
        <h3>Facelift<br>(Rhytidectomy)</h3>
        <p>A facelift is the most comprehensive approach to treating facial wrinkles and sagging caused by aging. It removes excess skin, tightens underlying tissues and muscle and re-drapes skin on the face and neck. It can correct mid face sagging, marionette
          lines, jowls and a double chin, maintaining its reputation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fifth-procedure">
        <h3>Eyelid Surgery<br>(Blepharoplasty)</h3>
        <p>Eyelid surgery, or blepharoplasty, is a surgical procedure to improve the appearance of the eyelids. Surgery can be performed on the upper lids, lower lids or both.</p>
